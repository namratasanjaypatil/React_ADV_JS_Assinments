• What is Redux? 
=>   Redux was inspired by Flux but it omitted the unnecessary complexity: it does not have Dispatcher 
    concept, has a single Store and the Action objects is received and handled directly by Store in the
    Redux. Redux is used by ReactJS for building the user interface and to manage the application state.


• What is Redux Thunk used for? 
=> Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.
    The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is
    met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.

 
• What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component? 
=> It is the type of component which re-renders only when the props passed to it changes and not even if
    its parent component re-renders or if the should Component Update()method is called. It is greatly used 
    to enhance the performance of a web application.


• What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is its purpose?
=> The second parameter to setState() is an optional callback function that will be executed once setState 
    is completed and the component is re-rendered. ComponentDidUpdate should be used instead to apply such 
    logic in most cases. You may directly pass an object as the first argument to setState instead of a 
    function.

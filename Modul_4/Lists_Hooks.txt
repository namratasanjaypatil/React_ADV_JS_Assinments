In React.js, hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a 
class. Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 and have become a popular way to manage state and side effects 
in functional components. Here is a list of commonly used hooks in React.js:


1. useState: Used to add state to functional components. 

2. useEffect: Used to perform side effects in functional components (e.g., fetching data, subscribing to 
events). 

3. useContext: Used to access a React context in functional components.

4. useReducer: Used to manage complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or actions.

5. useCallback: Used to memoize functions, preventing unnecessary re-rendering of child components.

6. useMemo: Used to memoize values, preventing unnecessary re-computation of expensive operations.

7. useRef: Used to create a mutable reference that persists across re-renders.

8. useImperativeHandle: Used to customize the instance value that's exposed to parent components when using
`ref`.

9. useLayoutEffect: Similar to `useEffect`, but runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.

10. useDebugValue: Used to display a custom label for custom hooks in React DevTools.


These are the most commonly used hooks in React.js, but there are also some additional hooks like 
`useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, etc., that provide more specialized functionality. It's important to 
note that hooks should only be used in functional components or other custom hooks, and not in regular 
JavaScript functions or class components.
